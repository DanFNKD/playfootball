# Play Football





The website was created to give people across London the possibility to participate in football sessions. It aims to create a sense of community and encourage people of all abilities to play the beautiful game.

The site contains a home page with three sections, a benefits page outlining some of the many reasons to participate and a contact page that allows visitors to sign up and receive alerts about new sessions in their area.

A live version of the project can be found here -

## UX

### User Demographic

This website was created for:

    - People that played Football in their youth and want to reconnect with the sport.
    - People that have never played Football before and want to start doing so.
    - People that want to learn more about the sport's benefits.

### User Stories


### New Users

    - As a new user I want to learn more about where I can play Football in the London area
    - As a new user I want to be motivated to start/resume playing

### User Goals

    - Find out about Play Football sessions
    - Understand more about Football
    - Understand more about the physical and mental benefits of playing
    - Join a likeminded community
    - Receive updates on new sessions that are easier/more convenient for me to attend 

### Requirements

A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies that I have learned so far containing some of the more advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version control system such as GitHub.

Required technologies: HTML & CSS

### Design

As this was my first project, the design has been influence by the "Love Running" project as well as my past experience with website design.

My objective was to create a site that was minimalistic, clean and had high readability. There isn't a targetted demographic therefore ensuring that the website felt agnostic was key.

The Play Football website is divided into three sections: header, body and footer. The navigation in the header uses an icon from 768 pixels and down.

### Colors

There are two colors used throughout the website, white (#ffffff) and dark green (#023020). The green was inspired by the color of a football pitch and using a dark shade increased user readability.

### Typography

The [Google Font Bebas Neue] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?query=bebas+neue) was chosen as the font for the header elements with a fallback of Sans-Serif.

The [Google Font Montserrat] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) was chosen as the font for paragraph elements with a fallback font of Sans-Serif.

### Images

Images have been chosen in accordance with the color and content. The purpose of the website is to inspire and motivate.

# Features

Home Page

Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, this responsive navigation bar includes the logo and links to the home, benefits and signup pages. It allows users to easily navigate from page to page without using the 'back' button.

Home page image

The image of a football pitch reaffirms the mission of the site, showing the pitch from an aerial view gives perspective, attempting to communicate the scale of the game.

Introduction section

The copy on the page provides an overview of the sport, before leading on to the core function of the site, using positive language throughout to encourage participation.

Sessions section

This section provides an overview of the location, match types, timings and durations of the sessions.

Footer section

This section includes links to the various Play Football social media pages. They open in a new tab to allow easy navigation and ensure that the user doesn't lose their position on the site.
This is a valuable tool for the site as it allows users to view content, sign up and build interactions to facilitate growth for the site.

Benefits Page

Header image

The image of a crowd attending a match aims to highlight the popularity of the game and social elements. 

Benefits section

A selection of physical and mental benefits are outlined to summarise the vast benefits of participating in football. Brief descriptions are used to maintain attention and icons are used to break up the copy. On larger screens, the physical benefits go on one side and the mental on the other, emphasising how the sport is good for both.

Youtube video

An inspirational video has been added to the bottom of the page to demonstrate the emotional side of the sport. The use of music in the video is emotive and aims to further encourage participation.
